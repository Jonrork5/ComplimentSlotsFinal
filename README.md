What We Have here is Compliment Slots! A Day Making Machine that will output a compliment after a simple "SPIN" Command. Using 3 tables containing adjectives, adjectives/verbs, and nouns and a program that pulls a random word from each table and uses it to form a 3 word structured compliment. This Project fulfills the requirments of creating a list populated with values that are then retrieved for use in the program, Comments that break down how a few items within use two of the SOLID Principles, and finally a log that records major events to a text file within the program as well. I hope you enjoy my simple yet fun Compliment Slot Machine!
